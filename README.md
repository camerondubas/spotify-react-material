## Spotify React Material

This project is a Work In Progress Web Player for Spotify that is built on React and Redux. It takes advantage of Material UI and the Spotify Web API.


### Project Goals

This purpose of this project is to build a fully functional web interface for Spotify. Due to limitations of the Spotify Web API, the playback is limited to 30 second clips of each song.

From a technilogical perscpective the goal for this project is to further build my experience with React and Redux in larger scale aplications as well as utilizing Material UI's React components to build interactive experiences matching Google's Material Design specification. Another goal is to gain a deeper understanding of the Spotify API.
